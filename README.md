# TriangulationSim
A model to explore the electoral consequences of centrist strategies.

This requires MatPlotLib to graph the results, you can see it here: https://matplotlib.org/

For basic users, changing the variables between lines 7-17 is advisable.

For advanced users, you can enable or disable triangulation by editine lines 42-50. Left triangulation is enabled by default.
You can also change whether the ideology is graphed as a line, what the legend shows, title, subtitle, legend, and axes by modifying the plot at the bottom of the page. It is by far the ugliest part of the code, so pursue at your own risk.
